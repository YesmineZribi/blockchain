# blockchain
My own implementation of a blockchain using Java.
BlockChain.java represents the entry point to the program. The program is given a file with an initial set of transactions and then proceeds to prompt the user for additional transactions. Transactions inputted by the user are then verified and if valid, a block for that transaction is added to the blockchain.

# blockchain
My own implementation of a blockchain using Java.
BlockChain.java represents the entry point to the program. The program is given a file with an initial set of transactions and then proceeds to prompt the user for additional transactions. Input files need to follow the format such as the one found in "blockchain_jzrib059.txt"
Transactions inputted by the user are then verified and if valid, a block for that transaction is added to the blockchain.
